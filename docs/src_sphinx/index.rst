This repository contains the Snitch-SDK, a stand-alone library for programming flavors of the `Snitch cluster <https://github.com/pulp-platform/snitch_cluster/tree/main>`_. The SDK provides a runtime environment for developing and deploying applications on various configurations of the Snitch cluster. It includes the core runtime, parallel programming (OMP) support, and different simulation targets (RTL, `Banshee <https://github.com/pulp-platform/banshee>`_).

The Snitch cluster and the Snitch-SDK are developed as part of the `PULP project <https://github.com/pulp-platform>`_, a joint effort between ETH Zurich and the University of Bologna.
